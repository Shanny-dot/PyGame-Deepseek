# PyGame-Deepseek

This project showcases R1's coding capabilities through a PyGame code generator and visualizer, integrated with browser automation. Powered by DeepSeek for reasoning, OpenAI for code extraction, and browser agents for visualization on [Trinket.io](https://trinket.io), this tool transforms natural language descriptions into interactive PyGame visualizations.

## Features

- **Natural Language to PyGame Code**: Generates PyGame code from user-provided descriptions.  
- **DeepSeek Reasoning**: Uses DeepSeek to analyze queries and explain code logic.  
- **Code Extraction**: Leverages OpenAI GPT-4o to extract clean, executable PyGame code.  
- **Automated Visualization**: Browser agents run and display the code on Trinket.io.  
- **Streamlit Interface**: Offers a user-friendly dashboard for input, code review, and visualization.  
- **Multi-Agent System**: Specialized agents handle navigation, coding, execution, and viewing tasks.

## How to Get Started
